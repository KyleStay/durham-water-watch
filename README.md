# Durham Water Watch

Durham Water Watch is an unofficial independent community dashboard for
Durham, North Carolina drinking-water reservoirs, drought conditions, and
current water-use rules.

The application:

- renders a resident-first English and Spanish overview;
- links every operational metric to an authoritative City, NC DMAC, or USGS source;
- stores verified values and accumulated readings in Cloudflare D1;
- refreshes stale sources server-side without blocking page rendering;
- preserves last-known-good values and quarantines invalid, older, or implausible readings;
- treats drought classification, shortage response, elevation, and streamflow as distinct concepts.

Official City guidance always takes precedence.

## Local development

```bash
npm install

The visible correction-contact placeholder must be replaced before a public
launch.
